--------------YAML & JSON -----------------

Create a YAML and JSON file for storing productdetails such as product, price, quantity, orderNumber .
 OrderNumber will further divided into orderDate and OrderInvoiceValue.
product will be further divided into productName productDescription and productRating
Solution 1 (JSON): 
{

  “product”:[
{
“productName”: ”camelin pencil”
},
{
“product description”: null,
“product details”:{
“product specs”:”0.7mm”,
“product colour”:”pink”
“productrating”:4.5

},
],
“price”:”20 per unit”
“quantity”:{
“mfd qty”:
“sold qty”:
}, 
     “orderNumber”:{
         “orderDate”: “04/09/2020”,
“orderInvoiceValue”:”455678”
}
}


Solution 2 (YAML):
---
product Details:
 -product:
             -productName :camelin pencils
             -product Description:
product Details:
               product specs:0.7 mm
               product colour:pink
              -product Rating:4.5
                
-price:20
-quantity
mfd qty: 6890
sold qty:700
-orderNumber:
-orderDate:04/09/2020
-orderInvoiceValue: 4556788
